# etch-a-sketch
After updating the UI of my last project making more use of the DOM I am more confident on using javascript to manipulate the DOM and i looking forward to this new project to solidify my understanding of using javascript to manipulate the DOM. Should be exciting
After completing this project I have to say that this was a fun project though I had some challenges

where I had challenges
1. Creating the divs was very challenging. Doing this with CSS would have been easy but as instructed I had to do this with javascript
2. Getting the user's input to make the div's creation dynamic was another challenge I faced. I had to ask questions to overcome this challenge because i felt i was missing something as the userInput wasn't updating the input variable outside the eventlistener for the userOption button.

These are the two areas I had the most challenge

How I overcame these challenges
1. I was able to create the divs by using a for loop twice meaning a loop within a loop.
I came up with this idea because in my head I thought to myself that if a container could use flex-direction row and column at the same time then this would be easy but that wasn't possible. The only way that would be possible was to use flex-direction on the direct descendants of the parent element and then use it again on the descendants. 

2. For the second challenge I faced, what I was made to understand was that it was updating all along but due to how i console logged the values and the fact that I wasn't properly reassiging the variable for iteration was the reason I wasn't getting what I wanted. As soon as I fixed this it worked as it should 
   
   
I see a lot of things i can still do here to make it 
more personalized but a programmer should always know
when to stop adding more functionality.
